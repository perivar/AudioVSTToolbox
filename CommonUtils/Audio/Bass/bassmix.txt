What's the point?
=================
BASSmix is an extension to the BASS audio library, providing the ability
to mix together multiple BASS channels, with resampling and matrix mixing
features. It also provides the ability to go the other way and split a
BASS channel into multiple channels.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required. Adjustment of the sample rate conversion quality (via
the BASS_ATTRIB_SRC attribute) requires BASS 2.4.9.


Using BASSmix
=============
The usage information in the BASS.TXT file (from the BASS package) is also
applicable to BASSmix and other add-ons.

TIP: The BASSmix.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSmix documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.


Latest Version
==============
The latest versions of BASSmix & BASS can be found at the BASS website:
